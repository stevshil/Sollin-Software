Sollin-Software
===============

Sollin media system software. A private project.

You will also need to download the following zip file;
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5682093/sollin/Sollin-LiveOS-LXDM.zip
and extract it in the DVD-Creator2/DVD directory as this is the LiveOS files which are too big for github.

For the older DVD-Creator project in the DVD directory the images folder can be found at;
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5682093/sollin/Sollin-images-FC14-Gnome.zip
You need this to be able to boot the system, same as the LiveOS for the LXDM version
