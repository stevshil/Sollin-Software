Setting Up The File Server

1. The server is configured to listen and work on 192.168.13.150
	- it uses 192.168.13.1 as its router to talk to the internet.
	- You may need to change the DNS server in /etc/resolv.conf 
		- currently uses 192.168.13.1
2. The directory that will contain the information for building DVDs is
	- /builds
	- It is owned by sol1004
	- sol1004 uses the usual password

3. The /builds directory is shared to both Windows and Linux
	- For Windows you should use the sol1004 user as authentication
	- Set up a Windows Mapped drive to \\192.168.13.150\builds

4. The Linux build server will mount this directory when it boots
	- NOTE: You should boot the File Server before the build server

5. The sol1004 user automatically logs in at boot time
	- A GUI is presented so that you can manage the system if required
