build-solin-dvd is a shell script that can be used in 1 of 2 ways;
1. Interactive
	Type in the details as prompted
	Note, that if you specify dhcp as the argument it will generate DHCP based IP systems, but will still ask for time zone.

2. Answer file
	Create files with the following format
		IP=192.168.1.1
		GW=192.168.1.254
		NM=255.255.255.0
		NS=192.168.1.254,192.168.1.253

Where;
	IP is the IP address for the host
	GW is the default gateway of the host
	NM is the netmask for the host
	NS is a single, or comma separated list of DNS server

An example file is included called example-ip-config-file.  You can create as many files as you like and then run the command with each file name in turn, burning a DVD for each one.

The script modifies the .ks files for install and build and then builds 2 DVD 
ISO images which can then be burnt to DVD.  If using Linux K3B is probably the 
best tool to do this with.
