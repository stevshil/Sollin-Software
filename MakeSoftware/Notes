ONE TIME ONLY
	1. Install rpm-build and rpmdevtools
	2. run rpm-setuptree
	This creates the necessary directory structure under your home directory to build RPM packages
	3. Edit the .rpmmacros file in your home directory, so that it contains only;
	%_topdir      %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild
	%_tmppath     %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild/tmp

BUILDING THE RPM
1. On the system where the software has been installed perform the following
	cd /
	tar cvf /tmp/sollin-1.0.0.tar.gz /home/sol1004 /usr/java/jrel.6.0_25/lib/i386/librxtxSerial.so /usr/java/jrel.6.0_25/lib/ext/RXTXcomm.jar

2. Copy the /tmp/sollin-1.0.0.tar.gz file to rpmbuild/SOURCES directory
3. cd to the rpmbuild/SOURCES directory and run the tgz2rpm.sh command
	tgz2rpm.sh sollin-1.0.0.tar.gz
4. move the .spec file created to rpmbuild/SPECS
5. Edit the .spec file so that the paths in the %files section all have a / at the beginning of them
6. Now build the rpm
	rpmbuild -ba SPECS/sollin-1.0.0.spec
7. Copy the file in the RPMS folder (sollin-1.0.0-0.i686) to the DVD/Packages directory
	NOTE: if you don't build the file as sollin-1.0.0.tar.gz which productes sollin-1.0.0-0.i686.rpm, then you will need to change the .ks files to match the name of the rpm (minus the rpm name).  Search for sollin and then change to the correct version.


The rpms directory contains the initial rpms, src rpms and spec file used.
